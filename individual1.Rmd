```
# 1) The majority of the ratings full between rating two and rating four, hence the frequencies of ratings in that interval being far higher than the others. 
# There are outlier(s) on the interval between ratings 4.5 and 5.

```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating,main = "Rating vs. Cocoa %", xlab= "Cocoa %", ylab = "Rating")
```
# 2
# It appears that the majority of chocolate that contain a cocoa percentage between 60 and 90 have the most ratings over 3. So I would say there is a correlation that states chocolate with a cocoa percentage in between 60 and 90 have a better chance of recieving a higher rating.
